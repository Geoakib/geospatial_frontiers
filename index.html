    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is designed as a single-page dashboard with a fixed top navigation for easy access to the core domains (Remote Sensing, GIS, Geography) and their critical Intersections. The default 'Home' view presents the report's executive summary alongside an interactive diagram of the three fields, immediately establishing the theme of convergence. Each domain section uses a card-based layout where users can click to expand and read about specific frontiers, preventing information overload. The 'Intersections' section uses a dynamic radar chart to visually represent how different interdisciplinary topics rely on each core domain, offering a more engaging and comparative analytical tool than simple text. This structure was chosen to transform the linear report into a non-linear, exploratory experience, allowing users to dive into topics based on interest rather than report order, thus enhancing usability and comprehension. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        1. Home - Overlapping Circles Diagram: Report Info -> Core relationship between RS, GIS, Geo. Goal -> Organize/Inform. Viz -> HTML/CSS diagram. Interaction -> Hover to highlight, click to navigate. Justification -> Visually introduces the report's central theme of convergence immediately. Method -> HTML/CSS with JS listeners.
        2. Domain Sections - Interactive Cards: Report Info -> Detailed frontiers for each domain. Goal -> Inform/Organize. Viz -> Accordion-style cards. Interaction -> Click to expand/collapse. Justification -> Breaks down dense text into manageable, user-triggered chunks. Method -> HTML/CSS with JS toggles.
        3. Intersections - Dynamic Radar Chart: Report Info -> How interdisciplinary topics leverage the three domains. Goal -> Compare/Relationships. Viz -> Radar Chart. Interaction -> Click buttons to update chart data for different topics. Justification -> Provides a quantitative-like visual comparison of the interplay between fields, which is more impactful than text alone. Library -> Chart.js (Canvas).
        4. Text Content: All textual information is loaded from a structured JS object to dynamically populate sections, keeping the HTML clean and the application performant.
